I am an senior mathematics major at Columbia University interested in differential geometry with a focus on complex geometry and geometric analysis. Currently, I'm working on a senior thesis supervised by Professor [Duong Phong](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~phong/), where I am working on the Kahler-Ricci flow and Hermitian-Einstein metrics on singular spaces and sheaves.  

Previously, I did readings with Professor [Michael Thaddeus](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~thaddeus/) on Yang-Mills connections and the moduli of vector bundles. I also worked with Professor [Mikhail Khovanov](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~khovanov/) on researching a correspondence between finite automata and a certain generalization of topological quantum field theories. Finally, I participated in the DIMACS REU, where I worked on a project studying a class of compact complex surfaces called fake projective planes, supervised by Professor Lev [Borisov](https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~borisov/). 

I'm currently the Editor-in-Chief and cofounder of the [Columbia Journal of Undergraduate Mathematics](https://journals.library.columbia.edu/index.php/cjum/index), now in its second year publishing original expository articles written by undergraduates. I have also been heavily involved in the [Columbia Undergraduate Math Society](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~ums/), where I was the president for two years.
